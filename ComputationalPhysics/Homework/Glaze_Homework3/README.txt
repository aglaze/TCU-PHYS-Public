This folder contains my submission for Homework 3. Each IPython notebook in this
folder is the solution for one problem. The files in this notebook are solutions
named according to their corresponding problem (Ex: Glaze_H3_P1.ipynb for the 
solution to problem 1). Each file is self-contained and does not write any 
output files. Problem 1 has the option of accepting user inputs for the function 
but the code as written uses kwargs to keep the user input from printing. You 
can remove the argument to prompt the user input if you so desire.

For this assignment I worked on my own. I peer-reviewed Jonah's work, and he 
reviewed mine, but the comments I received were not conducive to completing the 
assignment. For Problem 1, I was having a lot of trouble getting my own root 
function to work, so I used the scipy.optimize.root_scalar() function (sorry) so
that I could have *something* to turn in for this problem.
