Homework 2 Submission

Within the submitted folder are this file and three .ipynb files, named for the
respective problem solution they contain (e.g. "Glaze_H2_P1.ipynb" contains the
solution for problem 1 of homework 2). All files are self-contained and require
no outside input files and do not save any external output files.

During this assignment, I worked on my own and did not collaborate with other
students. However, I had not fully completed the assignment when we had our in-
class peer review session. I reviewed April's work and Iver reviewed mine.
Iver's feedback influenced my work, and while I did not review April's code for
the purpose of taking any ideas or inspiration, the nature of the exercise 
means I cannot guarantee that the process had no influence on my work.
